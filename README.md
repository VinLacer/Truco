# Truco ðŸŽ²

Just a simple game coded for the final project of Data Structures 1. This is a simple game of cards commonly played in pairs, but in this case is a 1v1 game, just to practice data structures.

I intend to build an IA using a minimax algorithm to turn the game more competitive and fun, and maybe some graphics stuff. In the actual state of the engine, the game is a PLAYER vs PLAYER game and has some issues.

But if you want to test this engine follow the next steps.
Build Instructions and run:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/VinLacer/Truco
$ cd Truco
```
```
$ make run
```
