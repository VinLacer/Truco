# Truco ðŸŽ²

Just a simple game coded for the final project of Data Structures 1.
This is a simple game of cards common played in pairs, but in this case is a 1v1 game, just to practice data structures.

I intend to build a IA using a minimax algorithm to turn the game more competitive and fun, and maybe some graphics stuff . In the actual stage of the engine the game is PLAYER vs PLAYER game and have sume issues. 

But if you want to test this engine follow the next steps.

Build Instructions:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/VinLacer/Truco
$ cd Truco
```
Run:
```
$ make run
```

Thanks.
